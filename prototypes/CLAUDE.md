# Gains Dashboard - Design Prototypes

Create 2-3 distinct design prototypes for a fitness dashboard. These are PROTOTYPES ONLY - do not touch index.html.

## Requirements
- **Modern, clean, dark theme**
- Mobile-first responsive
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no build tools)
- Use placeholder/mock data (don't need to load workouts.json)

## Create These Files
- `prototype-1.html` - Minimalist/Apple-inspired (lots of whitespace, subtle gradients, SF Pro vibes)
- `prototype-2.html` - Glassmorphism (frosted glass cards, blur effects, depth)
- `prototype-3.html` - Bento grid (like iOS widgets, mixed card sizes, playful but clean)

## Content to Include (use mock data)
Each prototype should show:
- Header with name/streak
- Quick stats row (workouts this week, PRs, streak)
- PR board (4-6 personal records)
- Progress chart placeholder (can be a styled div)
- Recent workouts list (3-4 entries)
- Maybe 1-2 insights/tips

## Design Inspiration
- Linear.app (clean, minimal, great dark mode)
- Raycast (modern macOS aesthetic)
- Arc browser (playful but polished)
- Apple Fitness+ (health dashboard vibes)

## Color Palettes to Try

### Prototype 1 - Minimal
- Background: #000000 or #0a0a0a
- Cards: #141414
- Accent: single color (electric blue #0A84FF or green #30D158)
- Text: #ffffff, #888888

### Prototype 2 - Glass
- Background: gradient (dark purple to dark blue)
- Cards: rgba(255,255,255,0.05) with backdrop-filter: blur
- Borders: rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
- Accents: vibrant gradients

### Prototype 3 - Bento
- Background: #0d0d0d
- Cards: varied sizes, #1a1a1a
- Accent: warm (orange #FF9F0A) or cool (purple #BF5AF2)
- Playful iconography

## When Done
1. Take screenshots of each prototype (full page)
   - Use: `screencapture -o prototype-1.png` etc.
   - Or open in browser and screenshot
2. Run: `openclaw gateway wake --text 'Prototypes ready - screenshots taken' --mode now`

## DO NOT
- Modify index.html
- Push to git
- Deploy anything

Focus on visual design and polish. Make them look GOOD.
